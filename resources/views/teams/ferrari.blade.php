                        <span>For many, Ferrari and Formula 1 racing have become inseparable. The only team to have competed
                            in every season since the world championship began, the Prancing Horse has grown from the humble
                            dream of founder Enzo Ferrari to become one of the most iconic and recognised brands in the
                            world. Success came quickly through the likes of Alberto Ascari and John Surtees, and continued
                            â€“ in amongst leaner times â€“ with Niki Lauda in the 1970s and then Michael Schumacher in the
                            2000s, when Ferrari claimed a then unprecedented five consecutive title doubles, securing their
                            status as the most successful and decorated team in F1 history...</span>

                        Born in the Mediterranean idyll of Monaco, Leclerc arrived in F1 on a tidal wave of expectation.<br>

                        Practically peerless on his way to the GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array of
                        skills from scorching pole positions, commanding victories â€“ even when his car caught fire twice at
                        Silverstone â€“ to an ability to muscle his way through the pack. Winning back-to-back championships
                        also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool in the big pond of Formula 1
                        racing.<br>

                        Stepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays and racing
                        brilliance on Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits â€“ and earning himself a money-canâ€™t-buy
                        race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the shoes of the Scuderiaâ€™s last world champion, Kimi
                        Raikkonen.<br>

                        There he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to go wheel-to-wheel with
                        established number one, Sebastian Vettel. A maiden F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week
                        later on Ferrariâ€™s hallowed home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another new hero â€“ who then
                        became the first man to out-score Vettel over a season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated in
                        crushing fashion the following year.<br>

                        Out of the car, Leclerc is modest and thoughtful - but then he is on his own very personal mission.
                        This exciting young talent is racing for his late father Herve and his friend and mentor Jules
                        Bianchi, the F1 driver who died in 2015.<br>

                        On the evidence so far, he is doing them both proud.

                    Carlos Sainz ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

                    <p><br>
                        Heâ€™s the matador from Madrid racing royalty.<br>

                        After entering F1â€™s Bull Ring paired alongside Max Verstappen at Toro Rosso in 2015, Sainz quickly
                        showed his fighting spirit. A tenacious racer, he puts the car on the edge as he hustles his way
                        through the pack. No wonder Sainz has earned the nickname Chilli.<br>

                        But the Spaniard is intelligent as well as instinctive, thinking his way through a race and into the
                        points. This calm temperament follows him off track where he remains unfazed by the pressures of
                        forging a Grand Prix career with a famous name.<br>

                        Sainz is the son of double World Rally champion, also his namesake, and has brought some of Dadâ€™s
                        driving skills to the F1 circuit â€“ junior loves a delicious dose of drift for one.<br>

                        After following in his famous fatherâ€™s tyre tracks, Sainz has had big racing boots to fill â€“ first
                        at McLaren where he replaced his childhood hero Fernando Alonso, and now at Ferrari, in the seat
                        formerly owned by Sebastian Vettel. It is never easy living in the shadow of sporting giants, but
                        Sainz has shown the drive and disposition to deal with it. Vamos!<br>
